        <p>This is the BBQ Sauce recipe that Aaron Franklin shares in his masterclass on BBQ.  
            It's a fantastic traditional sauce that goes with just about any BBQ.  I end up adding about &frac12; teaspoon of 
            cayanne pepper to give it a little zing.

        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a saucepan over medium heat, then add the 
                fat. Once the fat has coated the pan and begins 
                to shimmer, add the onion and cook until soft and 
                translucent, about 6–8 minutes. Add the garlic and 
                continue to cook over medium heat until the onion 
                has started to brown and the garlic has started 
                turning crisp, about 3 minutes more. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the brown sugar and cook, stirring frequently 
                until the sugar melts and starts to form a glaze, 
                about 2–3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the apple cider vinegar, ketchup, paprika, 
                mustard, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and                     
                cook for 3–5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly, 
                then add the Worcestershire sauce and 
                simmer for 1 more minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the sauce to a blender and blend at high 
                speed until the sauce is smooth and takes on an orange hue, approximately 1 minute. Be careful, as hot 
                liquids are liable to splatter in a blender. Pulse once 
                or twice before proceeding to a full blend. Transfer to 
                a heat-resistant container and allow to cool to room 
                temperature. Store in a refrigerator for up to 1 month.

        <p>
            Aaron prefers to use organic or all-natural ketchup that isn't made with high-fructose 
            corn syrup, as the lower sugar content makes the sauce less likely to burn in the smoker.
