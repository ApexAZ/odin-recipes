            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine the ingredients for the paste in a small bowl and slowly stir in 1/2 cup of hot water. Mix and set this aside for now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season the meat with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a large chili pot over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pot and add a few pieces of meat at a time. Sear the meat on all sides, about 2-3 minutes and remove it to a plate. Repeat the process until all the meat is seared. You may need a little more oil than what's listed just depends on how well marbled the meat is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you need it, add another drizzle of oil to the pan along with the chopped onions and the poblanos. Use a wooden spoon to help scrape any brown bits left behind by the meat and cook for 5 minutes.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, add the garlic and jalapeños and continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes or until fragrant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the prepared chili paste to the pot and stir it in so that it coats everything nicely. Allow the paste to cook for 1 minute before adding the brown sugar, Worcestershire, beef broth, tomato sauce, 1 cup water and ½ teaspoon salt. Use the wooden spoon to scrape the bottom so that none of the chili paste is sticking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the seared meat and allow the chili to come to a boil before lowering the heat to low and allowing it to cook for 2 ½ - 3 ½ hours. Set aside 1 cup of water and add in a ¼ cup every time you stir the chili if it's thickened. Stir the chili every 30-45 minutes to make sure it's not sticking. You may not need all of the water if you're going bean-free, with beans you generally need a little more. I like to add the beans around the 2-hour mark so that they have a chance to cook for at least half an hour before serving. Serve topped with all your favorite chili toppings!

            <h2>Notes</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="recipe-paragraph">
            <p>
                If you decide to use a chuck roast, just be sure to trim as much of the fat as you can. You don't need that. The natural marbling is more than enough. If you leave on the extra fat, the chili will end up being really oily at the end and you'll need to skim most of it off.
                You can also replace some of the water/beef broth with a bottle of beer or brewed coffee. It just comes down to preference.
