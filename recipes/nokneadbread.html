    <p>Jim Lahey's basic no kneed bread recipe is a favorite of mine.  
        It only requires 4 ingredients and results in a rustic, crusty bread that goes well with just about any meal.  
        The hardest part of this recipe is the 18 hour ferment period, so you have to plan ahead, otherwise, it's very little work 
        to prepare the dough and bake the boule.
