        <p>Jim Lahey's basic no kneed bread recipe is a favorite of mine.  
            It only requires 4 ingredients and results in a rustic, crusty bread that goes well with just about any meal.  
            The hardest part of this recipe is the 18 hour ferment period, so you have to plan ahead, otherwise, it's very little work 
            to prepare the dough and bake the boule.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="recipe-list">
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt and yeast.  
                Add the water and, using a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until you have a wet, sticky dough; about 30 seconds.  
                Make sure it's really sticky to the touch; if it's not, mix in another tablespoon or two of water.  
                Cover the bowl with a plate, tea towel, or plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature (about 72 degrees  F),
                 out of direct sunlight, until the surface is dotted with bubbles and the dough is more than doubled in size.  
                 This will take a minimum of 12 hours and (my preference) up to 18 hours.  This slow rise-fermentation-is the key to flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the first fermentation is complete, generously dust a work surface (a wooden or plastic cutting board is fine) 
                with flour.  Use a bowl scraper or rubber spatula to scrape the dough onto the board in one piece.  
                When you begin to pull the dough away from the bowl, it will cling in long, thin strands 
                (this is the developed gluten), and will be quite loose and sticky-do not add more flour.  
                Use lightly floured hands or a bowl scraper or spatula to lift the edges of the dough in toward the center.  
                Nudge and tuck in the edges of the dough to make it round.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a cotton or linen tea towel (not terry cloth to avoid lint and sticking) or a large 
                cloth napkin on your work surface and generously dust with wheat bran, cornmeal or flour.  
                Use your hands or a bowl scraper or wooden spatula to gently lift the dough onto the towel, 
                so it is seam side down.  If the dough is tacky, dust the top lightly with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour.  
                Fold the ends of the towel loosely over the dough to cover it and place it in a warm, draft-free 
                spot to rise for 1 to 2 hours.  The dough is ready when it is almost doubled in size.  
                If you gently poke it with your finger, making an indentation about &frac14; inch deep, it should hold 
                the impression.  If it doesn't, let it rise for another 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Half an hour before the end of the second rise, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F, with a rack 
                in the lower third position, and place a covered 4&frac12; to 5&frac12; quart heavy pot (or dutch oven) 
                in the center of the rack to preheat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using pot holders, carefully remove the preheated pot from the oven and uncover it.  
                Unfold the tea towel, lightly dust the dough with flour or bran, lift up the dough, either on the towel or in your hand, and quickly 
                but gently invert it into the pot, seam side up.  Cover the pot and bake for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                 After 30 minutes, remove the lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep chestnut color 
                 but not burnt; 15 to 30 minutes more.  Use a heatproof spatula or pot holders to carefully lift 
                 the bread out of the pot and place it on a rack to cool thoroughly.  Don't slice or tear into it 
                 until it has cooled, which usually takes at least an hour.
